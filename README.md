# ðŸŒ— Light/Dark Mode Switcher

This is a minimalist HTML + JavaScript project that displays a short haiku and includes a button to toggle between light and dark mode.

Everything is generated dynamically using JavaScript: there is no static HTML content inside the `<body>` tag.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Creates a styled container with a three-line haiku
- Includes a toggle button for switching between light and dark themes
- Uses reusable style objects for easy customization
- Written in vanilla JavaScript (no dependencies)

## ðŸ›  How It Works

- HTML is minimal and only includes the metadata and script reference
- The script (`index.js`) dynamically:
  - Creates the content and appends it to the DOM
  - Adds a dark mode toggle with styled elements
  - Applies styles using structured JavaScript objects
